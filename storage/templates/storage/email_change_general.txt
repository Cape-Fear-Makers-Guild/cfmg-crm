Dear All,

{{ user }} has {% if rq.created %}requested{% else %}updated the information for{% endif %} storage for:

	  {{ rq.what }}

   Owner: {{ rq.owner }}
Location: {{ rq.location }}
   Until: {{ rq.lastdate }} ({{ rq.duration }} days)

          {{ rq.extra_info }}
{% if rq.state == 'R' %}
This request requires the approval from the members of this mailing list. Until then
it will stay in the 'requested' state; while {{ owner }} will need to wait 
before storing {{ what }} at the space.
{% elif rq.state == 'AG' %}
As this is (the first) request for short term storage of this item; it has been
automatically approved for thirty days.
{% elif rq.state == '1st' %}
This is is a request for an extension of the initial 30 days. It will be automatically
approved in 5 days unless objections are raised.
{% elif rq.state == 'OK' %}
This request has been approved (by the deelnemers@ or the trustees).
{% elif rq.state == 'NO' %}
This request has been rejected. If already at the space {{what}}
should be removed from the space as soon as possible (and becomes
fair game to re-use or throw in the bin after 5 days).
{% elif srq.tate == 'R' %}
This request ha been rescinded -- the storage spae is no longer needed.
{% endif %}
