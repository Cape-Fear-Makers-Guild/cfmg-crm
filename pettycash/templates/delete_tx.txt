L.S.

Just to let you know; we had the transaction below was DELETED 
by {{ user }}:

  from   {{ src_label }}
    to   {{ dst_label }}

 status  DELETED 

  when   {{ tx.date }}

         {{ tx.amount }}

         {{ tx.description}}

Should this be wrong; let one of the trustee's know at {{ settings.TRUSTEES }}.
