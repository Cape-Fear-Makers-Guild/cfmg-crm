L.S.

Just to let you know; we had the following transaction made:

  from   {{ src_label }}
    to   {{ dst_label }}

  when   {{ tx.date }}

         {{ tx.amount }}

         {{ tx.description}}

Should this be wrong; let one of the trustee's know at {{ settings.TRUSTEES }}. The 
full details of this transaction can be seen at  <{{ base }}{% url 'transactiondetail' pk=tx.pk  %}>.
This is also the place where you can delete a transaction.
