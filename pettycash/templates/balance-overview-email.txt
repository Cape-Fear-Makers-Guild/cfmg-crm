Subject: [makerbot] Everyones account balances for this month

Folks,

It is that time of the month again. Your spacebot has been doing the
sums; and below are everyones balances.

As always - you can see the complete list at

	{{ base }}{% url 'balances' %} 

where you can also browse to the specific transactions.  And here you 
can also fix any mistakes.

Or consult your personal page at:

	{{ base }}{% url 'mytransactions' %} 

for just your own transactions.

Yours,

the makerspace bot, on behalf of the trustees (bestuur@makerspaceleiden.nl).

Balances as of {{ date }}

{% for b in balances %}
{{ b.owner|rjust:30 }} {{ b.balance }}{% endfor %}
