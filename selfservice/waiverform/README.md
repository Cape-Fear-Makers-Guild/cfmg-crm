## Waiver form generation

The form is generated by overlapping a PDF template generated externally with text generated internally.

The PDF template is generated using [this Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pSNKjA1WFNz7HvQYMeaM6Scmw_j-zsJ-xYa3N4RSX5s/edit?usp=sharing).
If the document is not available anymore, use the .ODT file in this directory to upload again, or find another means for creating the background PDF.

The overlay text is generated via code in `waiverform.py`
